The goal of rgeobon is to provide an interface between R and the [GEOBON open data portal](https://portal.geobon.org/) RESTfull API (please note that the portal is currently in beta). It allows to consult the datasets available on the portal and download them. 

## Installation

You can install rgeobon from GitHub:

``` r
devtools::install_github("vlucet/rgeobon")
```

## Example

This demonstrates the basic abilities of `rgeobon`. You can first get the list of all the available datasets:

```{r example}
library(rgeobon)
# Get the list of GEOBON datasets
dataset_list <- geobon_list()
head(dataset_list)
```

From here, you can request information on a single record, and download the data associated with this record, if any is available. 

```{r example_followup}
# Get a specific record
geobon_get(id = 49)

# Download the data from that record into a temp directory
geobon_download(id = 49, path = tempdir())
```
