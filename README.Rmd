The goal of geobon is to provide an interface between R and the [GEOBON open data portal](https://portal.geobon.org/index>) RESTfull API (please note that the portal is currently in beta). It allows to consult the datasets available on the portal and download them. 

## Installation

You can install geobon from GitHub:

``` r
devtools::install_github("vlucet/geobon")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(geobon)
# Get the list of geobin datasets
dataset_list <- geobon_list()
head(dataset_list)

# Get a specific record
geobon_get(id = 49)

# Download the data from that record
geobon_download(id = 49, path = tempdir())
```
